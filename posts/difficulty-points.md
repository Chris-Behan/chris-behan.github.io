“There are no points for difficulty.” is a harmful piece of advice. It’s a piece of advice generally given in the context of work that promotes taking the easy, more efficient path. A piece of advice that I couldn’t disagree with more. “There are no points for difficulty” if you believe all that matters is the outcome and not your ability to produce that outcome. It’s this line of thinking that high schoolers use to rationalize writing their essays with GPT-3, or repping out practice questions to do well on a test instead of trying to actually understand the material. It’s the results-obsessed reasoning that’s so prevalent in media, social and otherwise, that gives disproportionate attention to a model’s 6-pack or a CEO’s multi-billion dollar exit while skipping over the process that led to those results.

The most important life lesson that’s missed in school, or at least that was missed for me, is the importance of the process. It’s pretty silly to spend a long time playing a game you hate just for a brief moment of fleeting pleasure that comes when you beat it. Especially for games that take years or even decades to beat. Examples that come to mind include getting a degree you’re disinterested in because careers in that field pay well or reading a terrible book just so you can say that you did it. You’re going to spend infinitely more time working on a thing, heads down immersed in the process, than you will be enjoying the fruits of your labor. Tolerating disinterest or even despisal of something for the hope of some speculative, ephemeral, future reward, is insanity. Especially if the achievement of your desired outcome is in a competitive domain, as you’ll most certainly lose to someone who actually enjoys the game they’re playing.

Now obviously, even if you love what you do, there are always difficult, unenjoyable, and frustrating times. Times where if you truly internalized “There are no points for difficulty”, you’d quit. “This is too hard, there must be an easier way.” You’d rationalize to yourself as you prepare to surrender. “There are no points for difficulty” is impatient. It’s the ethos of those people writing articles on speed reading or making YouTube videos on how to learn python in 10 minutes. It undervalues your ability to get better by trying and failing to overcome difficult tasks and the immense personal gratification you experience from doing something you didn’t think was possible. You’re much more likely to persist through a challenge if your motto is “Fail frequently” than some soft-ass, outcome-obsessed message like “There are no points for difficulty” or “Work smarter not harder”. The old saying that there are no peaks without valleys is true. I’ve gotten way more satisfaction out of solving seemingly impossible-to-find bugs in code than I have from being promoted. And I think most programmers would agree.

Times are changing. Everyone and their dog now has access to generative AI models that can produce incredible art and pretty good literature in a matter of seconds. We’re experiencing the TikTokification of intellectual work in real time. And the result will be a convergence of content towards a melting pot of similarity. 
Generative models vastly reduce the number of inputs that go into the creative process.
Instead of having to think about each sentence and how it contributes to the idea of the paragraph, or how that paragraph flows into the next,
you simply ask the model to write you an article on why X is better than Y.
The model then searches a giant set of data, looking for information on X and Y, along with examples of writing that compares 2 things, then it outputs the result.
Done.
The problem is, when you had to write each sentence yourself, the likelihood of you writing the same thing as someone else was very small.
But when all you need to do is write a prompt explaining what you want to write, the likelihood of that prompt being the same as someone else's goes way up.
And since you're all using the same model, trained on the same set of data, the results will be almost identical.
Put a hundred writers in a room and tell them to write an article on why Democracy is better than dictatorship and you'll get 100 very different papers.
But if you put the same 100 writers in the room and tell them to use ChatGPT to write an article on why Democracy is better than dictatorship, you might just get the same paper 100 times.

Right now, it's especially important to neglect the idea that "There are no points for difficulty".
To avoid being the founder that creates one of 10,000 non-differentiable ChatGPT startups. 
To avoid being the artist that abandons their pursuit of drawing to become a “Prompter” for DALL-E 2. 
To avoid being the writer that off-loads their ability to write, and thus think, to ChatGPT. 
In a time where it’s never been easier to avoid difficulty, the differentiator will be your ability to embrace it.
