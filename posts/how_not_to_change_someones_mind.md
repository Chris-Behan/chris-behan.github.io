Your neighbour Walter is a fool. He supports that evil political party and follows that backwards
religion. It's shocking to you how someone who lives right next door, who sends their kids to the
same school as yours, and who also enjoys smoking brisket on their porch, could hold such
unacceptable views. Here's how _not_ to change Walter's mind, how to make him double down on his
beliefs, and how to make him resent your own.

## 1. Tell, don't ask

Instead of asking Walter why he believes what he does, tell him
that he's wrong and that your beliefs are obviously right. By not listening to the experiences
that led to Walter's beliefs, you eliminate the possibility of understanding why he thinks the
way he does. And by not understanding the 'why' behind Walter's perspective, you remove the risk
of agreeing with his thought process and possibly changing your own. Additionally, Walter will
interpret your unwillingness to listen as arrogance. He'll associate your _obviously right_
beliefs and values with those of closed-minded assholes. From his experience, people who
hold these beliefs and values (you), are unwilling to listen, and disregard alternative viewpoints
as foolish. When criticizing Walter's beliefs, be sure to raise your voice and use the word "You"
as much as possible. By blurring the line between Walter and his beliefs, he'll interpret your
attack on his ideology as an attack on him. And our natural reaction when we're attacked is to
defend. Walter will reflexively defend himself and his beliefs, which you treat as one and the same,
while simultaneously developing resentment towards your beliefs (the beliefs of his attacker).
Once someone's entered a defensive mindset, they're no longer receptive to new ideas.
Their sole focus is on winning the encounter, which in the context of intellectual debate means being
"right", as opposed to finding the truth.

## 2. Combine the Minority with the Majority

Find cases of exceptionally stupid people who share Walter's beliefs, then falsely infer that
everyone who shares his beliefs is stupid. Every ideological group has radicals. Seek out the most
sensational examples from this minority of radicals and apply their negative attributes to the majority.
For example, if belief A has a small group of violent followers, condemn belief A in
its entirety by claiming _all_ its followers are violent. This strategy works for any and all beliefs,
from religion to technology. Your dishonest argument which was made solely to discredit Walter's beliefs
will signal to him that you have no true intention of understanding. And having just compared Walter
to stupid radicals, he'll never share his true thoughts with you again, for fear of being compared to
stupid radicals.

## 3. Use Labels

To avoid productive discourse, slap negative labels on the most prominent members of Walter's
ideology so that you can discredit their perspective without having to contend with their arguments.
This will save you immense time and energy while ensuring your own perspective remains static.

Example:

```
Walter: "<Prominent member of ideology> talks about how <rationale for belief>, which really resonates with me."
You: "<Prominent member of ideology> is a <negative label>!".
```

9/10 times the conversation ends once the label has been applied. If Walter tries to continue the conversation
after the application of the label, ask him if he supports `<negative label>`, and subtly infer that
by continuing the conversation he himself is a `<negative label>`.
The use of labels allows you to sneakily throw out the intellectual baby with Walter's ideological
bathwater.

## 4. Use Strawman Arguments

A "Strawman" argument is when you take someone's argument, distort it into a weaker argument, then
attack that weaker argument. By distorting their argument into one that is obviously wrong, you
stand up the metaphorical "Strawman", allowing you to easily assault the defenseless Scarecrow.
Common distortions include removing context, oversimplifying, exaggerating, or misrepresenting
the argument entirely.

Example:

```
Walter: "Intermittent fasting is good for you"
You: "But if you starve yourself you'll have no energy".
```

You've distorted Walter's argument by
replacing "Intermittent fasting" with "Starvation" which is obviously harmful and easy to attack.
If Walter doesn't notice your manipulation of words, he'll hopelessly try and defend the argument
"Starvation is good for you".
