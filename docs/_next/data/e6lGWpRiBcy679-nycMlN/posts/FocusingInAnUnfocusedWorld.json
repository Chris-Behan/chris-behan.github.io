{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"FocusingInAnUnfocusedWorld","content":"The current generation is characterized by a lack of focus.\r\nGone are the days of engrossing ourselves in the task at hand.\r\nInstead, we engage in a constant cycle of context-switching and cheap dopamine hits.\r\nWe start out the day by mindlessly scrolling our social media feeds.\r\nNext up, skim read a few articles from our go-to news source. \r\nIf an article looks worthy of more than a skim-read, we bookmark it for later, adding it to the backlog of 40 other articles we plan to read soon.\r\nWe habitually check the tickers of $GME and bitcoin, as if their price fluctuates from minute to minute (oh wait....).\r\nWe're bombarded with notifications and reminders from a plethora of applications that have become integrated into our daily routine.\r\nThe modern environment doesn't just facilitate a lack of focus, it encourages it.\r\n\r\nFocus inhibitors like Slack and Microsoft Teams have made their way into the workplace under the guise of *communication* and *productivity* enhancers.\r\nWhat these applications really do, is add to the already saturated pool of things fighting for our attention.\r\nOur environment has conditioned us to seek constant stimulus while reducing our attention-span to mere minutes.\r\nMany of us can no longer bear to devote our full attention to the task at hand without some sort of stimulus to ease the pain. \r\nA great example of this is listening to music while working.\r\nMusic is a form of stimulus used to evade boredom and avoid the mental effort required for focusing.\r\nMost of us can agree with this statement, especially in the context of work.\r\nHowever, some claim that music helps them focus, to which I present the following scenario:\r\n\r\nImagine you're on a game show where you'll be asked a question that requires mental arithmetic. You'll have 2 minutes to come up with an answer, and if you're correct, you win $1 Million.\r\nWould you listen to music during the 2 minutes to help you \"focus\" or would you contemplate the question in dead-silence?\r\nSurely you would choose dead-silence, thus solidifying my point that music does not help you focus, but rather provides auditory stimulus to evade boredom.\r\nDon't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with listening to music, I listen to ~2 hours of music a day, but I do so leisurely, not to help me focus while working.\r\nThe problem is that we've become accustomed to constant distractions and stimulus, making it impossible to attain a state of focus, and consequently inhibiting our productivity.\r\n\r\nSo what's the solution? \r\nHow can one attain focus in an environment that encourages anything but?\r\nShould we just concede, sell all of our belongings and move to a remote cabin in the woods?\r\nThat's one solution, however, I believe there's a less drastic compromise.\r\n\r\nHere are 5 habits I've developed to help me focus in an unfocused world:\r\n\r\n### 1. Get rid of your damn phone\r\nFirst things first, get rid of your damn phone.\r\nPut it in a different room, or better yet, a different building.\r\nPrior to Covid, when I still went to the office for work every day, I used to just leave my phone at home. Man oh man was this ever great for productivity. \r\nI didn't give myself the option to check my phone and splurge on some cheap-dopamine.\r\nUnfortunately, in the WFH era, I can't *easily* leave my phone in another building. \r\nBut I can do the next best thing, leave it in a separate room, behind closed doors.\r\nI've found that even having my phone in sight makes entering a state of focus more difficult. \r\nA 2017 [study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462) from the University of Texas at Austin supports this claim.\r\nEnvironment is underrated, ruthlessly remove distractions and temptations from your office space, keep your phone in a different room while working.\r\n\r\n### 2. Brown Noise\r\nThis is a simple habit I've been practicing for a few years now, and I can't recommend it enough.\r\nEvery day at work, when not in a call, I listen to brown noise on a continuous loop. \r\nIt helps to eliminate auditory distractions and focus on the task at hand.\r\nI think I've also subconsciously associated the sound of brown noise with work and entering into a productive state.\r\nSo when I start the brown noise, my mind knows it's time to buckle down and get to work.\r\nHere's the specific track I listen to: [Soft Brown Noise](https://open.spotify.com/track/129ldjjvnFfA7Ygc8ktYnh?si=862cda07fd694806) \r\n\r\n### 3. Must-complete list\r\nFocus is best accompanied by intent.\r\nI start my day by writing down a list of 1-3 tasks that I **must** complete for the day.\r\nI write the tasks down in the past-tense, as if they are already done, to further emphasize to myself that their completion is non-negotiable.\r\nI will not end my day until every task on the list is complete.\r\nThis practice has helped me to eliminate shallow \"busy work\" where I would constantly context-switch between my text-editor, emails, Slack, meetings, and design documents. \r\nIf your goal is to give yourself the *illusion* of productivity, constant context-switching is great!\r\nHowever, *Real* productivity is the result of clearly defined tasks that you see through to completion.\r\nIf you find yourself mindlessly switching through applications with no clear goal in mind, take a step back and write down a list of clearly defined tasks. \r\nIf you're still wandering despite having a task list, you probably made the tasks too general. \r\nTry breaking them down into fine-grained deliverables.\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n\"Add cart functionality\"\r\nmight be broken down into:\r\n\r\n* Implement GET method for /Cart endpoint to retrieve items in the customer's cart.\r\n* Implement POST method for /Cart endpoint to add items to the customer's cart.\r\n* Write integration tests for /Cart endpoint.\r\n* Consume /Cart endpoint from front-end.\r\n\r\nIt's incredible how much more effective you can be by simply breaking down tasks into digestible components.\r\nAnother bonus of the \"must-complete list\" is that you can use it to give clear and concise stand-up updates. \r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. Exercise + Cold\r\nFocus is a finite resource that diminishes over time.\r\nFortunately, it can also be replenished through breaks, and certain breaks increase how much it's replenished.\r\nNothing revitalizes focus and obliterates that 2 O'clock feeling like some hard exercise followed by a cold shower.\r\nPlus, now that your working from home, it's easy to allocate 45 minutes every day to implement this practice.\r\nMy go-to is a hard 35 minutes on the spin bike followed by an ice-cold shower.\r\nI usually do this when I start to notice my focus is diminishing.\r\nShortly after I feel refreshed and ready to put in some deep work.\r\n\r\n### 5. Coffee\r\nI'm a huge advocate of coffee, both for the taste and the mental effects.\r\nAnd contrary to popular belief, [coffee is good for you](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3), especially black coffee.\r\nI like to start my day with a large cup of black coffee and re-up every 2 hours until about 2 pm.\r\nSometimes I feel a little too relaxed after my exercise + cold, at which point I'll down another cup of Joe to offset the fatigue.\r\nEveryone's different, but I drink between 4-6 cups of coffee a day and feel great.\r\n\r\nHave a habit that helps you focus?\r\nI'd love to hear about it!
