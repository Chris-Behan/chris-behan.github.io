{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"theoreticians_and_pragmatists","content":"\r\nThere are two distinct realities in a constant conflict with one another. How things are talked about\r\nand how things really are. People who inhabit the first reality are called theoreticians.\r\nThey love to think and talk. They spend most of their waking hours in the space between\r\ntheir ears. They underestimate the value of experimentation. And they overestimate the power of\r\nprediction. If a theoretician wants to start\r\nrunning, he first researches the best running shoes, then he reads about what distances\r\nhe should be running, what the best diet for a runner is, and what proper running form looks like.\r\nTheoreticians are often found in the confines of academia, but they exist in all fields.\r\nThey can be identified by their love of planning and their willingness to book meetings.\r\nThinking is the most important thing to the theoretician.\r\n\r\nPeople in the second reality are called pragmatists. They learn through hands-on experience and\r\nhave a strong bias for action. They're impatient when planning and believe you don't know what you\r\ndon't know. You rarely hear a pragmatist say things like \"ideally\" or \"I hope\". Pragmatists\r\noperate in the real, messy, world. The one where ideal scenarios are the exception, not\r\nthe rule. The pragmatist deals with problems as they are, not how they once were, or how they could\r\nbe. And to him, that's all that matters. If a pragmatist wants to start running, he puts on his shoes\r\nand hits the fucking pavement. Pragmatists tend to be craftsmen that build tangible things.\r\nThey're the intellectual descendants of Aristotle, who famously said:\r\n\"for the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.\"\r\n\r\nConversely, theoreticians learn about something by reading about it. In casual conversation\r\nwith a theoretician and a pragmatist, the theoretician comes across as far more articulate and\r\nknowledgeable. He knows all of the definitions, dates, and historical\r\nevents for the topic being discussed. The pragmatist isn't as well versed in the semantics of the\r\ntopic because he's too busy actually doing. In fact, the pragmatist doesn't read about the topic\r\nunless it's absolutely necessary. He's suspicious of how much value one can gain from talk or text.\r\n\"Advice is meaningless without the experience of seeing where it came from.\" the pragmatist says.\r\nWhile the theoretician is reading up on musical theory, the pragmatist is playing the piano.\r\n\r\nThe school system was built by theoreticians.\r\nIn school, you're constantly told that you need to get good grades to succeed in life. You learn\r\nabout things by reading about them, and you're told you understand something if you can answer\r\nquestions about it. But in the real world, no one cares if you had a 4.0 GPA in college. There are\r\nno multiple-choice tests in the wild. Do you know what they call a student who graduated med school\r\nwith straight Cs? A doctor. Sure, academic performance\r\ncan be a strong indicator of your trajectory in life, but it's far from a guarantee. And that's\r\nbecause school operates in the theoretician's reality. It's only an indicator of success because\r\nsome of the traits that lead to success in the theoretician's reality also translate to the real\r\nworld, like focus and discipline. But there are other traits that are never\r\nexplicitly tested in the classroom, like communication skills and whether or not you're the type of person that someone would want to grab a beer with.\r\nAnd if you're completely inept in these departments, no level of focus, discipline, or intellect will help you to succeed.\r\n\r\nTheoreticians, whose acquisition of knowledge comes from thinking, spend a lot of time studying\r\nthe past and planning the future. They study history to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors\r\nwithout having to spend the time it took to make those mistakes. But can you really learn a lesson\r\nwithout having experienced it firsthand? Is the reason history repeats itself because nobody in a\r\nposition of power ever cracked open a history book? Or is it human nature to believe that this time\r\nwill be different? That the rules don't apply to you and that things have changed. If you can really\r\nlearn a lifetime's worth of lessons from a week's worth of reading then the theoreticians may be on\r\nto something. Communist regimes could avoid spending decades building systems that are destined to\r\nfail. Governments could avoid waging [unwinnable wars in the Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_of_empires).\r\nAnd investors could avoid losing it all in obvious asset bubbles. But the pragmatist is skeptical of this reality.\r\nHis mother always told him to wear his helmet while riding his bike.\r\nBut it wasn't until he fell and got a concussion that he truly understood the advice.\r\n\r\nThe theoretician believes he can plan and predict the future. He\r\ndevelops complex theories about what the future looks like using even more complex models. And he has\r\nfaith in the accuracy of his models because they use intricate mathematics that he studied in school.\r\nHe can't help but feel that the words in his textbooks are irrefutable.\r\nHow could he question the theory of a renowned Harvard math professor?\r\nTo an outsider, the theoretician looks like an Oracle. Every prediction he tells you about\r\ncomes true. His models are perfect. But it's important to ask yourself if the\r\ntheoretician is being selective about which predictions he shares. Anyone can look like a genius by making\r\nmillions of predictions and only talking about the one or two that came true.\r\n\r\nSerious problems arise when you use predictions from a theoretician to make decisions in the real\r\nworld. [Modern Monetary Theorists](https://www.investopedia.com/modern-monetary-theory-mmt-4588060), born and raised in the theoretician's reality, have convinced governments that\r\nit's okay to print as much money as they need without worrying about inflation. And we're\r\nactively experiencing the catastrophic consequences of this very wrong prediction. Unfortunately,\r\nit's people in the real world, not the theorists, who are left holding the bag. Modern monetary\r\ntheorists don't have to pay for half the gas tank of the construction worker whose daily commute has doubled\r\nin cost. They don't have to subsidize the incomes of blue-collar families who can no longer afford\r\nrent. No, instead they get to rest comfortably in the bowels of academia, working on the sequel to\r\ntheir disastrous theory.\r\n\r\nThe pragmatist is skeptical of talk from people who don't have skin in the game.\r\nThat's why he disregards the promises of politicians and the predictions of media pundits.\r\nHe knows they're never held accountable for their mistakes. When seeking advice, the pragmatist\r\ndoesn't ask someone what they'd do, he asks what they've done. He knows that advising someone to\r\nbet their life on something and betting your own life, are two completely different things. \"Talk is\r\nfree.\" says the pragmatist. And if talk is free, then planning and meetings are dirt cheap.\r\n\r\nThe idea that you can plan the outcomes of the future by having a meeting is almost universally\r\naccepted in corporations. Fantasies of businessmen in suit and tie solving the world's problems from\r\na fluorescent-lit conference room have infiltrated the minds of employees across the globe. It's an\r\nattractive thought. You don't actually have to take action to produce results, you can just plan\r\nthat action. The implementation is easy, the theoretician tells himself. It's the idea, the plan\r\nthat matters. But as Mike Tyson once said, \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.\"\r\nAnd reality is guaranteed to hit your plan with a vicious right hook the moment it steps into the ring.\r\n\r\nMost meetings are useless.\r\nDecisions are deferred, progress is postponed, and creation is canceled.\r\nThese things don't happen in meetings.\r\nThey happen in focused solitude and collaborative work sessions.\r\nAnd no, a meeting is not a collaborative work session.\r\nA team debating the path forward through the rigorous evaluation of each path's pros and cons is a collaborative work session.\r\nA meeting is a gathering of people, often too large for effective communication, who share status updates that could have easily been communicated via email.\r\nThey're an exercise in text-to-speech for people that are too lazy to read and write.\r\nThey're a form of laziness that provides the gratification of achievement through the illusion of progress.\r\nThe theoretician loves meetings because they involve his favourite activity: talking.\r\nMeetings give the theoretician an opportunity to show how smart he is.\r\nHe relishes in the oohs and ahhs he receives for his grandiose plans.\r\nHe's deluded himself into believing that talking about something is the same as working on something.\r\n\r\nThe pragmatist detests useless meetings.\r\nHe's fully aware that talking is not the same as working.\r\nHis first instinct in the face of ambiguity isn't to book a meeting.\r\nIt's to clearly communicate his thoughts in writing, then to leverage the technology at his disposal to get feedback on those thoughts.\r\nHe values time above all else and is painfully aware of the cost of meetings.\r\nIf his hand is forced and a meeting is required, he writes a succinct document to focus and facilitate the conversation.\r\nHe speaks with brevity and refocuses the theoreticians in attendance who can't help but go off on tangents.\r\nAnd as soon as the meeting is over, he gets back to work.\r\nHe knows that iteration beats the best plan.\r\nThat great works are emergent, not scheduled.\r\nThat great books are written one sentence at a time.\r\nThat great programs are written one feature at a time.\r\nThat great films are shot one scene at a time.\r\nAnd that the creators of these works had no idea what the final version would look like before they started.\r\n\r\nNo one lives exclusively in one reality or the other.\r\nThe successful pragmatist has to spend some time strategizing.\r\nAnd there are lessons he learns from studying the past (the list is just smaller than you'd think).\r\nThe successful theoretician eventually has to act.\r\nTo stop talking and get to work.\r\nTo write his theory.\r\n\r\nYou're better off spending most of your time in the pragmatist's reality.\r\nThis is the reality that the ancients referred to as \"the present\".\r\nThe only place where you're in control.\r\nThe hard part is figuring out when you need to visit the theoretician's reality.\r\nAnd making sure that you don't stay there for too long.\r\n","title":"Theoreticians and Pragmatists","description":"How things are talked about is not how they really are.","date":"2022-07-10","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chris-Behan/chris-behan.github.io/master/public/images/plato_aristotle.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
