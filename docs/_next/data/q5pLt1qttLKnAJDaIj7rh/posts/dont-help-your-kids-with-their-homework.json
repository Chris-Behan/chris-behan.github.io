Encourage their child to figure it out on their own, and reinforce their ability to do so.\r\n2. Recommend resources for learning, like Google.\r\n3. Emphasize that the purpose of school is to *learn* and that failure and struggle are *required* steps in the learning process.\r\n\r\nIt's never too late to stop helping your kids with their homework.\r\nThey'll thank you for it in the long term.\r\nRip off the band-aid, let them get bad grades, let them fail, let them **learn**.","title":"Don't help your kids with their homework","description":"Why helping your kids with their homework.","date":"2021-04-18"}},"__N_SSG":true}
