This is a fucking tragedy.\r\n\r\nIt's a tragedy because it contradicts our innate desire for a destination. There is no level of competence that is immune to deterioration. You can set yourself any arbitrary goal: run a marathon, get a promotion, build a strong relationship, but the destination is temporary. The second you stop training, working, and building, the trajectory trends downwards. Stagnation is not the default state, decline is. I ran a [half marathon in February](https://twitter.com/behan_chris/status/1355381404146704386) and haven't run since. I decided to go for a run the other day (4 months later) and coughed up a lung around the 6km mark. I'm confident I'll be back to my old self in no time, but the fact remains that abilities decline, and they decline quicker than you'd think.\r\n\r\nThe fact that skills are perishable and the reality that time is limited means you can't be good at everything. By choosing to invest time into something, you are also choosing **not** to spend time on something else. The decision to play video games is also a decision not to read.
