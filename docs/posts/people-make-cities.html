With each passing day of isolation, my psyche descended further into the depths of negativity. By the six-week mark, my sanity was on the brink. I had to get out.

<em>The lads in Calgary</em></p><p>My advice to my future self is this: Don&#x27;t put yourself in a scenario where your entire social life is dependent on your job. And don&#x27;t move somewhere strictly based on environmental factors. Instead, choose to live somewhere because of the people. Optimize for environmental factors that attract the type of people you want to be around. If you want to be around entrepreneurs, move somewhere that&#x27;s known for having lots of venture capital. If you want to be around basketball players, move somewhere with lots of courts. Environmental factors should be used to find communities that you want to be a part of, not an end in themselves. Because at the end of the day, the relationships and experiences you develop with others will bring you far more meaning in life than a desirable climate or proximity to a historic site.</p></article><hr class="mt-4"/><div class="signup_container__3ynE0"><p class="signup_subscribeText__3S405">Like what you read? <br/> Share with others and Subscribe</p><form class="signup_signupForm__36osG" action="https://97afcce2.sibforms.com/serve/MUIEAFn3FZzUf7t-OKK-YuxOzBVWrigWMnUU0m0uDnAhLANE9V7_mvearUT3JDq7ek3460GOlt9xsdTbIFxJzQhTODT3ng3hCJDSn5VKJHIpeSIemdm_WIjVe35TlQjTONLxRfgbB_M5FZoZUH9mTNP6mI4aDKVhqYx8SaHUDsmEWzOMEVwluujbKxN-PRrhUa2CK8QrQkr_o0ve" method="POST" datatype="subscription" novalidate=""><input type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Email" id="EMAIL" value="" autoCapitalize="off" autoCorrect="off"/><input type="submit" class="signup_subscribeButton__3vM6l" href="#" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe"/><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="Please leave the following three fields empty"><label for="b_name">Name: </label><input type="text" name="b_name" tabindex="-1" value="" placeholder="Freddie" id="b_name"/><label for="b_email">Email: </label><input type="email" name="b_email" tabindex="-1" value="" placeholder="youremail@gmail.com" id="b_email"/><label for="b_comment">Comment: </label><textarea name="b_comment" tabindex="-1" placeholder="Please comment" id="b_comment"></textarea></div></form></div></main><div><a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"people-make-cities","content":"\r\nPeople make cities.
