Our biological feedback mechanisms are very poor at evaluating short-term vs. long-term rewards. So any task that involves suffering (mentally or physically) or a large expenditure of energy, is going to be less popular than an easy and pleasurable task.

Books are a step up, both in difficulty and reward. They generally require more of your focus than a movie, and depending on the genre, are more likely to instill you with valuable knowledge, ideas, or perspectives that you can use in your own life.
