This may be true to an extent, chip makers and CPU designers are very bright, however their domain expertise is likely isolated to an extremely specific component of the CPU. It is important when analyzing any complex concept to acknowledge all of its components. In the case of a CPU, there are thousands of components built on top of each-other.</p><p>Don&#x27;t be disheartened if a concept appears incomprehensible at first glance, it may very well be incomprehensible to those who created it, particularly when that concept is at the bleeding edge of technology. How can a CPU designer design a CPU without understanding all of its inner workings? The same way an architect designs a house without understanding the details of construction, and the same way a software developer uses an API without understanding its implementation details. Complex technologies and concepts are not the result of omniscient individuals, but rather layers of knowledge, built upon, and composed of one-another. The authors of these layers of knowledge are the specialists, who have spent years mastering the knowledge associated with their layer. The mental model for understanding these layers, and the central topic of this essay, is <strong>Knowledge APIs</strong></p><blockquote><p>Knowledge API: A mental model for thinking about the understanding of a specific domain as an Application Programming Interface (API). Knowledge APIs depend on, and can be used by one-another. A knowledge API is like a module in a programming language, it depends on (imports) other knowledge APIs, and can be used by (exported) other knowledge APIs. - Chris Behan</p></blockquote><p>To illustrate the idea of a knowledge API, let&#x27;s use CPUs as an example. Suppose one of the knowledge APIs used in CPU production is dedicated to the etching of microscopic lines into silicon.
