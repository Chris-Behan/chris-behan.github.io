After suppressing your initial surprise, you shift your focus to the game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_draw">5-card draw</a>. You pick up your freshly dealt hand off the beer-stained velvet. 10 of Clubs, Queen of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds, King of Spades, Jack of Clubs. You rearrange them in descending order: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9; a straight, booyah.</p><p>Let&#x27;s pause for a moment. How did you rearrange the cards in your hand? Would you say that you had to <em>think</em> to do this? You probably started out by placing the King at the leftmost position in your hand.
