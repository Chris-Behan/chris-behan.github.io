A paradigm in which the best products are able to constantly adapt to the changing demands of the market.</p><p>My immediate thought when considering this question is that the specific technical details of the software are less important than the team that builds it.

The type of wonder you experienced the first time you used Google search. It should feel empowering. To achieve this it needs a target audience. If it tries to please everyone, it’ll please no one. Vim is a great text editor for programmers. But for your parents who are just trying to compose an email, it’s a needlessly complicated set of hotkeys, devoid of the buttons and icons they’re accustomed to. It’s unlikely a team will produce something delightful on their first attempt, so they’ll need to iterate based on feedback from their users. This requires a combination of courage and self-awareness. They need the courage to release something that isn’t perfect and the self-awareness to realize that they won’t produce perfection in a silo. They need to communicate with their users and be receptive to feedback, especially uncomfortable feedback. They need to think backwards from the user. Remaining constantly aware that they are in the business of producing software for an end-user, not writing code for the sake of writing code. And the only way this can be achieved is if they use the product they’re making. Successful brewmasters drink their own beer. If the team only interfaces with the code, they’ll forget about what it outputs, a program. They’ll fall into the trap of months-long internal changes that have no noticeable effect on the end-user, like changing a test framework or migrating to the hottest new programming language, while failing to realize the opportunity cost of neglecting features that users actually care about.</p><h2>The perfect piece of software solves a problem.</h2><p>And in a similar vein to the fallibility of trying to please everyone, it shouldn’t try to solve every problem. It should solve a single, well-defined problem, and solve it well. It should solve a problem that actually exists. Not a problem its founders invented. One way to ensure you’re solving a real problem is to pick one that members of the team have (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">shoutout Paul Graham</a>), which comes with the added benefit of guaranteeing that the development team uses their product. To solve the problem well it’ll need many iterations, which adapt based on feedback from its users. A common pattern is arising: the importance of iteration and courage (courage is required for soliciting and thoughtfully considering feedback). To have many iterations you need lots of time or lots of speed. And in a competitive environment where demand is constantly changing, fortune favors the fast. The iteration speed of a software product has two main factors: the output of the team and the complexity of the system. The output of the team roughly equates to how much they work multiplied by the focus of that work. Depending on who you ask the output of this equation is maximal in a four-day workweek or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system">Chinese 996</a>. The second part of the equation, complexity of the system, determines how efficient that output is. In a simple, well-architected system, entirely new features can be shipped in a few weeks, whereas in an overly complex system, the same change could take years. The complexity of a software system grows by default. The more code you write, the more opportunities there are for bugs to arise. Even if no code is being added to the system, its complexity grows as its dependencies become outdated and require patching. The only way to tame this ever-growing complexity is to constantly refactor. Members of the perfect team understand this. They strive to make the house a little cleaner every time they enter. They heed the advice of Douglas Crockford, creator of JSON and JSLint, and spend every sixth development cycle refactoring code.</p><h2>The perfect piece of software has no bugs.</h2><p>An achievement many believe to be impossible for any complex program, especially a SaaS. And maybe it is, but we can still try and describe the team and processes with the highest probability of achieving bug-free software. The code that composes bug-free software must be as simple as possible. The code must be written in such a way that it has “obviously no bugs”, as opposed to “no obvious bugs”. Simplicity and readability must be the north star of the dev team. The authors need to possess a healthy amount of skepticism towards the code they write and that of their teammates. They need to evaluate what the code actually does, not what someone says it does. They need to possess a mentality of quality assurance that manifests as a strong desire to find bugs in their own code. And they need to write tests upon tests to try and expose these bugs. The authors of the perfect piece of code practice strict code ownership. Code contributors are intimately familiar with the section of the code that they’re changing.

A team that never rushes their implementation or skimps on unit tests to meet a deadline. A team that moves slow to move fast. By never compromising their principles in the face of short team goals, they’re able to move at a steady, some would even say “fast” pace in the long term.

To ensure these qualities the development team must hold the three goals of security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in their heads at all times.
